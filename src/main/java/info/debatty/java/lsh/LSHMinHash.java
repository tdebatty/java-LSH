     * rows of at least one stage (band), and therefore become a candidate
     * pair, is 1−(1−s^R)^b

     * Jaccard index similarity, has a S shape.
     * The threshold (the value of similarity at which the probability of
     * becoming a candidate is 1/2) is a function of the number of stages
     * (s, or bands b in the book) and the signature size:
     * threshold ≃ (1/s)^(1/R)
